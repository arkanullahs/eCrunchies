# eCrunchies

eCrunchies is a modern, cross‑platform food discovery and ordering app built with Flutter and Firebase. Users can explore restaurants, view menus, add items to cart, chat about orders, receive notifications, and place orders seamlessly. The project includes a simple restaurant dashboard for viewing items and orders.

## 1) Overview
This repository contains a Flutter application targeting Android, iOS, Web, Windows, macOS, and Linux. Firebase is used for authentication, data storage, and (optionally) notifications. The app is designed for a clear, intuitive food ordering flow.

## 2) Features
- **Onboarding & Auth**
  - Welcome flow and user type selection (`lib/welcome_screen.dart`, `lib/user_type_selection.dart`, `lib/user_type.dart`)
  - Email/password authentication screens (`lib/login_screen.dart`, `lib/signup_screen.dart`, `lib/auth_page.dart`)
- **Discovery & Menus**
  - Discover restaurants and foods (`lib/discover_screen.dart`, `lib/FullRestaurantList.dart`, `lib/foods_screen.dart`, `lib/food_items_screen.dart`)
  - Detailed food pages (`lib/food_details_screen.dart`, `lib/restaurant_menu_screen.dart`)
- **Ordering**
  - Create and review orders (`lib/order_screen.dart`)
  - Order confirmation view (`lib/order_confirmation_page.dart`)
- **Chat & Notifications**
  - In‑app order chat (`lib/order_chat_screen.dart`, `lib/message_model.dart`)
  - Notification handling (`lib/notification_controller.dart`)
- **Restaurant Dashboard (Basic)**
  - See items and orders (`lib/restaurant_dash.dart`, `lib/restaurant_dash_show_items.dart`, `lib/restaurant_dash_show_order_list.dart`)
- **Multi‑platform**
  - Android, iOS, Web, Windows, macOS, Linux project scaffolding

## 3) Screens at a Glance
- `welcome_screen.dart`: Intro/welcome experience
- `user_type_selection.dart`: Choose role (e.g., user/restaurant)
- `login_screen.dart`, `signup_screen.dart`, `auth_page.dart`: Auth flow
- `discover_screen.dart`: Entry to discovery
- `FullRestaurantList.dart`, `foods_screen.dart`, `food_items_screen.dart`: Browse restaurants/foods
- `food_details_screen.dart`, `restaurant_menu_screen.dart`: Item and menu detail
- `order_screen.dart`, `order_confirmation_page.dart`: Checkout/confirmation
- `order_chat_screen.dart`: Order-related chat
- `restaurant_dash.dart`, `restaurant_dash_show_items.dart`, `restaurant_dash_show_order_list.dart`: Basic restaurant tools

Data models:
- `food_model.dart`: Food item structure
- `message_model.dart`: Chat message structure

## 4) Tech Stack
- **Flutter** (Dart) for UI and multi‑platform support
- **Firebase** via FlutterFire for:
  - Authentication (email/password, and optionally providers)
  - Cloud Firestore (app data)
  - Cloud Storage (images)
  - Cloud Messaging (push notifications; optional)

## 5) Project Structure
High‑level directories:
- `lib/`: Main Dart source (screens, models, controllers)
- `assets/`: Images, video, placeholders used in UI
- `android/`, `ios/`, `macos/`, `linux/`, `windows/`, `web/`: Platform projects

Key files inside `lib/`:
- `main.dart`: App entry point, Firebase initialization (`lib/firebase_options.dart`)
- `firebase_options.dart`: Auto‑generated by FlutterFire CLI; holds per‑platform Firebase config
- `notification_controller.dart`: Local/push notification handling

## 6) Getting Started
Prerequisites:
- Flutter SDK installed and on PATH (Flutter 3.x recommended)
- Dart SDK (bundled with Flutter)
- A Firebase project (see Firebase Setup below)

Install dependencies:
```bash
flutter pub get
```

## 7) Firebase Setup (All Platforms)
This project uses `lib/firebase_options.dart` (generated by FlutterFire) for initialization. If you need to configure or reconfigure Firebase:

1. Install FlutterFire CLI (one‑time):
```bash
dart pub global activate flutterfire_cli
```

2. Log in and select your Firebase project:
```bash
flutterfire configure
```
This will generate/update `lib/firebase_options.dart` and platform configs.

3. In the Firebase Console, enable products you use:
- Authentication (Email/Password)
- Cloud Firestore
- Cloud Storage
- Cloud Messaging (if using push notifications)

4. (Optional) Example Firestore Security Rules (start restrictive and adapt):
```bash
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /{document=**} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
    }
  }
}
```

Assets and images used in the UI can be uploaded to Firebase Storage or bundled in `assets/` as appropriate.

## 8) Running and Building
Run on a connected device/emulator/simulator:
```bash
flutter run
```

Build release binaries:
```bash
# Android APK
flutter build apk

# iOS (requires Xcode on macOS)
flutter build ios

# Web
flutter build web

# Windows
flutter build windows

# macOS
flutter build macos

# Linux
flutter build linux
```

## 9) Configuration Notes per Platform
- **Android**
  - Ensure `android/app/google-services.json` exists (placed by FlutterFire or manually downloaded)
  - `android/build.gradle` and `android/app/build.gradle` should contain Google services plugins (handled by FlutterFire)
- **iOS/macOS**
  - Ensure `ios/Runner/GoogleService-Info.plist` and `macos/Runner/GoogleService-Info.plist` exist
  - Open the iOS project in Xcode at least once to finish signing settings
- **Web**
  - `lib/firebase_options.dart` injects web config at runtime; ensure hosting domain is added in Firebase Auth settings
- **Windows/Linux**
  - Desktop builds require enabling desktop support in Flutter and having platform SDKs installed

## 10) Troubleshooting
- **Firebase initialization errors**: Regenerate config via `flutterfire configure`; confirm `firebase_options.dart` is imported in `main.dart`.
- **Missing Google services files**: Verify platform‑specific config files exist in `android/app/` and `ios/Runner/` (and `macos/Runner/` if used).
- **Authentication provider disabled**: Enable Email/Password in Firebase Console.
- **CORS or origin issues on Web**: Add your app’s domain to Firebase Auth authorized domains.
- **Build cache issues**: Try `flutter clean && flutter pub get`.
- **Gradle/Xcode errors**: Open platform project (Android Studio/Xcode), let it sync, and re‑run.
